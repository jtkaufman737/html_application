      <h1>Hello Shopstorm!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is JT Kaufman, and I am interested in your Customer Success Specialist role. I have a
            somewhat unusual background for a job like this, coming from recruiting. However I have
            extensive experience in supporting customers, be they government agencies or Program Managers.
            Recruiting trained me in masterful googling, excellent communication skills, and hustle.</p>
            <p> I recently made the decision to get into programming, and just completed a four month
              bootcamp teaching me Javascript, HTML, CSS, and some other technologies. I still consider
              myself new to coding, and would welcome an entry level opportunity to build my skills.
              I also know that while I'm newer to programming, my history of success in client facing
              roles would allow me to hit the ground running.

    <h1>Resolving Customer Qualms</h1>
      <p>At times, I have had to diplomatically remind customers of their Service Level Agreements when
        they have asked for services or man hours that were not part of a contract or agreement. I will
        be frank, it is never simple to tell people things they don't want to hear. But by being
        objective, providing concrete examples, active listening, and demonstrating empathy I have
        been able to reach understanding. </p>

     <h1>Is the customer always right?</h1>
     <p>I am a logical person, and have to say no. It is statistically impossible to be right 'all of
       the time'. I believe it is possible to know that and simultaneously realize that the saying
       really should be, 'The customer is always first'.</p>
       <p>Whether right or not, customers are the heart of your company. Their troubles and concerns
         are paramount to the health of your organization. So right or not, customers are first.
         This means truly listening to them before recommending solutions. Instilling confidence that
         you take their issue seriously, and will be pulling out all the stops to resolve it. And then
         finalizing the feedback loop: confirming what you think is a solution is seen that way by the
         customer too.</p>

      <h1>Favorite Emoji/Gif?</h1>
      <p>I don't know about gif or emoji, but I can share two videos that always make me giggle.</p>
      <p>I'm an animal lover, and I've been out of control ever since I discovered <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cat-brain-freeze_us_576ab611e4b0c0252e77edc8">
        cats getting brainfreeze</a>. The endless charms of the internet never cease to amaze me. There's also one of a racoon stealing a welcome mat that bears honorable mention, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEI55-gQ0fQ">here</a></p>
